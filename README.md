# Evalutaing Regression models for Boston Housing Prediction

The python code used in this project helps you to understand and estimate the accuracy of different regression algorithms on the dataset "housing.csv" which is a sub-dataset created from the original boston housing datasets. The number of features influencing the result are reduced for ease of understanding. The code produces the ouput of different algorithms including:
* Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Support Vector Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression

In the end, it produces the graph which contains error rate of each algorithm implying the most efficient algorithm.

## Libraries Required
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* SciKit-Learn

## Running the program
Once all the required libraries are installed, the program provides a CLI to work with and you are good to go.

Cheers :)
