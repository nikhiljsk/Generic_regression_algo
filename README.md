# Evalutaing Regression models on a dataset

The python code used in this project helps you to understand and estimate the accuracy of different regression algorithms on the dataset "housing.csv" which is a sub-dataset created from the original boston housing datasets. The number of features influencing the result are reduced for ease of understanding. The code produces the ouput of different algorithms including:
* Linear Regression
* Polynomial Regression
* Support Vector Regression
* Decision Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression

In the end, it produces the graph which contains error rate of each algorithm implying the most efficient algorithm.

## Libraries Required
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* SciKit-Learn

## Running the program
Once all the required libraries are installed, the program provides a CLI to work with and you are good to go.

## Running the program on your own dataset
You can use Generic_template.py to run the program on your own dataset, and get the error rates, so as to choose the best regression algorithm. 

Cheers :)
